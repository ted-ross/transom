# Get Involved

## Use our software

Our code is [open source](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0),
free to use, and built to help you solve problems.
[Download Qpid](@site-url@/download.html) and try it.

## Tell us about problems

If everything just works, great!  If not, tell us what's wrong.  You
can ask questions on the [user
list](@site-url@/mailing-lists.html#user-list) or [report a
bug](@site-url@/issues.html#report-a-bug).

## Follow what's happening

Qpid is an active community.  There's ongoing development of new
features, lots of bug fixing, and discussion of messaging
architecture.  Subscribe to our [mailing
lists](@site-url@/mailing-lists.html#subscribe) to watch our progress and voice
your opinion.

## Make Qpid work for you

Each new user brings a new use case and new challenges.  Maybe Qpid
doesn't do something that you need.  Since Qpid is open source, *you
can make Qpid do what you need*.  Write a patch and send it to us.  If
you want guidance, ask on the [developer
list](@site-url@/mailing-lists.html#developer-list).

## Write about it

We think Qpid is good stuff, and more people ought to know about it.
If you use Qpid to do something cool, tell others about it in a [blog
post](@site-url@/resources.html#blogs), news article, or your
project's website.  We really appreciate it.
