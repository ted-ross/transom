Our code is [open source](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0),
free to use, and built to help you solve problems.
[Download Qpid](@site-url@/download.html) and try it.

## Tell us about problems

If everything just works, great!  If not, tell us what's wrong.  You
can ask questions on the Qpid
[mailing lists](@site-url@/discussion.html#mailing-lists) or
[report a bug](@site-url@/issues.html#report-a-bug).

## Follow what's happening

Qpid is an active community.  There's ongoing development of new
features, lots of bug fixing, and discussion of messaging
architecture.  Subscribe to our
[mailing lists](@site-url@/discussion.html#subscribe) to watch our
progress and voice your opinion.

## Make Qpid work for you

Each new user brings new scenarios and new challenges.  Maybe Qpid
doesn't do something that you need.  Since Qpid is open source, *you
can make Qpid do what you need*.  Write a patch and send it to us.  If
you want guidance, [discuss it with us](@site-url@/discussion.html).

## Contribute

 - *Fix bugs* - Reporting bugs is a considerable service to us.
   Sending patches is even better.

 - *Test new releases* - Each new release goes through a long period
   of user testing, and we could use your feedback.  Tell us if it
   works in your environment, for your application.

 - *Write documentation* - Good documentation is as important as good
   code.  If you excel at clear communication, consider focusing your
   talents on our documentation.

 - *Develop new components* - If you have an idea and a need for a new
   component that speaks AMQP, you can build and host it at Qpid.

 - *Package Qpid for new environments* - Maybe Qpid isn't available
   from the package repository for your OS or language.  We want Qpid
   to be everywhere and just a few clicks away.  We value any
   expertise you have in offering Qpid in new places.

 - *Tell others about Qpid* - We think Qpid is good stuff, and more
   people ought to know about it.  If you use Qpid to do something
   cool, tell others about it in a
   [blog post](@site-url@/resources.html#blogs), news article, or your
   project's website.  We really appreciate it.
