      This release provides a preview of a new module for High Availability (HA). The new
      module is not yet complete or ready for production use, it being made available so
      that users can experiment with the new approach and provide feedback early in the
      development process.  Feedback should go to <a class="ulink" href="mailto:user@qpid.apache.org" target="_top">user@qpid.apache.org</a>.
    </p><p>
      The old cluster module takes an <em class="firstterm">active-active</em> approach,
      i.e. all the brokers in a cluster are able to handle client requests
      simultaneously. The new HA module takes an <em class="firstterm">active-passive</em>,
      <em class="firstterm">hot-standby</em> approach.
    </p><p>
      In an active-passive cluster, only one broker, known as the
      <em class="firstterm">primary</em>, is active and serving clients at a time. The other
      brokers are standing by as <em class="firstterm">backups</em>. Changes on the primary
      are immediately replicated to all the backups so they are always up-to-date or
      "hot".  If the primary fails, one of the backups is promoted to be the new
      primary. Clients fail-over to the new primary automatically. If there are multiple
      backups, the backups also fail-over to become backups of the new primary.
    </p><p>
      The new approach depends on an external <em class="firstterm">cluster resource
      manager</em> to detect failure of the primary and choose the new primary. The
      first supported resource manager will be <a class="ulink" href="https://fedorahosted.org/cluster/wiki/RGManager" target="_top">rgmanager</a>, but it will
      be possible to add integration with other resource managers in the future. The
      preview version is not integrated with any resource manager, you can use the
      <span class="command"><strong>qpid-ha</strong></span> tool to simulate the actions of a resource manager or do
      your own integration.
    </p><div class="section" title="1.13.1.1. Why the new approach?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id407302"></a>1.13.1.1. Why the new approach?</h4></div></div></div>
      The new active-passive approach has several advantages compared to the
      existing active-active cluster module.
      <div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
	  It does not depend directly on openais or corosync. It does not use multicast
	  which simplifies deployment.
	</li><li class="listitem">
	  It is more portable: in environments that don't support corosync, it can be
	  integrated with a resource manager available in that environment.
	</li><li class="listitem">
	  Replication to a <em class="firstterm">disaster recovery</em> site can be handled as
	  simply another node in the cluster, it does not require a separate replication
	  mechanism.

      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">
	  Transactional changes to queue state are not replicated atomically. If the

	</li><li class="listitem">
	  During a fail-over one backup is promoted to primary and any other backups switch to

	  A persistent broker must have its store erased before joining an existing cluster.
	  In the production version a persistent broker will be able to load its store and

	  Configuration changes (creating or deleting queues, exchanges and bindings) are

	  Deletions made immediately after a failure (before all the backups are ready) may

      To create a replicated queue or exchange, pass the argument
      <span class="command"><strong>qpid.replicate</strong></span> when creating the queue or exchange. It should
      have one of the following three values:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><em class="firstterm">all</em>: Replicate the queue or exchange, messages and bindings.

	</li><li class="listitem"><em class="firstterm">none</em>: Don't replicate, this is the default.

    Bindings are automatically replicated if the queue and exchange being bound both have
    replication argument of <span class="command"><strong>all</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>confguration</strong></span>, they are
    not replicated otherwise.

    You can create replicated queues and exchanges with the <span class="command"><strong>qpid-config</strong></span>
    management tool like this:
    <pre class="programlisting">
      qpid-config add queue myqueue --replicate all
    </pre>

    To create replicated queues and exchangs via the client API, add a <span class="command"><strong>node</strong></span> entry to the address like this:
    <pre class="programlisting">
      "myqueue;{create:always,node:{x-declare:{arguments:{'qpid.replicate':all}}}}"

      Clients can only connect to the single primary broker. All other brokers in the
      cluster are backups, and they automatically reject any attempt by a client to
      connect.
    </p><p>
      Clients are configured with the addreses of all of the brokers in the cluster.
      <sup>[<a name="id409105" href="#ftn.id409105" class="footnote">1</a>]</sup>
      When the client tries to connect initially, it will try all of its addresses until it
      successfully connects to the primary. If the primary fails, clients will try to
      try to re-connect to all the known brokers until they find the new primary.
    </p><p>
      Suppose your cluster has 3 nodes: <span class="command"><strong>node1</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>node2</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>node3</strong></span> all using the default AMQP port.
    </p><p>
      With the C++ client, you specify all the cluster addresses in a single URL, for example:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
	qpid::messaging::Connection c("node1:node2:node3");
      </pre><p>
    </p><p>
      With the python client, you specify <span class="command"><strong>reconnect=True</strong></span> and a list of <em class="replaceable"><code>host:port</code></em> addresses as <span class="command"><strong>reconnect_urls</strong></span> when calling <span class="command"><strong>establish</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>open</strong></span>
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
	connection = qpid.messaging.Connection.establish("node1", reconnect=True, "reconnect_urls=["node1", "node2", "node3"])

      Broker fail-over is managed by a <em class="firstterm">cluster resource
      manager</em>. The initial preview version of HA is not integrated with a
      resource manager, the production version will be integrated with <a class="ulink" href="https://fedorahosted.org/cluster/wiki/RGManager" target="_top">rgmanager</a> and it may
      be integrated with other resource managers in the future.
    </p><p>
      The resource manager is responsible for ensuring that there is exactly one broker
      is acting as primary at all times. It selects the initial primary broker when the
      cluster is started, detects failure of the primary, and chooses the backup to
      promote as the new primary.
    </p><p>
      You can simulate the actions of a resource manager, or indeed do your own
      integration with a resource manager using the <span class="command"><strong>qpid-ha</strong></span> tool.  The
      command
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
	qpid-ha promote -b <em class="replaceable"><code>host</code></em>:<em class="replaceable"><code>port</code></em>
      </pre><p>
      will promote the broker listening on
      <em class="replaceable"><code>host</code></em>:<em class="replaceable"><code>port</code></em> to be the primary.
      You should only promote a broker to primary when there is no other primary in the
      cluster. The brokers will not detect multiple primaries, they rely on the resource
      manager to do that.
    </p><p>
      A clustered broker always starts initially in <em class="firstterm">discovery</em>
      mode. It uses the addresses configured in the <span class="command"><strong>ha-brokers</strong></span>
      configuration option and tries to connect to each in turn until it finds to the
      primary. The resource manager is responsible for choosing on of the backups to
      promote as the initial primary.
    </p><p>
      If the primary fails, all the backups are disconnected and return to discovery mode.
      The resource manager chooses one to promote as the new primary. The other backups
      will eventually discover the new primary and reconnect.

      You can connect to a backup broker with the administrative tool
      <span class="command"><strong>qpid-ha</strong></span>. You can also connect with the tools
      <span class="command"><strong>qpid-config</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>qpid-route</strong></span> and
      <span class="command"><strong>qpid-stat</strong></span> if you pass the flag <span class="command"><strong>--ha-admin</strong></span> on the
      command line.  If you do connect to a backup you should not modify any of the
      replicated queues, as this will disrupt the replication and may result in
      message loss.
