## Report a bug

JIRA allows users to anonymously search issues, but an account is
required to create new ones.  [Sign up for an
account](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/Signup!default.jspa).

Before reporting a bug, [search existing
issues](#search-existing-issues) to see if it has already been
reported.  If it has, feel free to add a comment describing the case
where you see it.

If it hasn't, it's time to [report a
bug](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/CreateIssue.jspa?pid=12310520&amp;issuetype=1&amp;priority=3).
Two guidelines are essential.

 - Be specific.  What version of the software are you using?  What
   component?  What OS are you running it on?  What are you trying to
   do?  (Someone might very well buy you a beer if you include a
   script that reproduces the problem.)

 - Don't pile more than one problem into one bug.  The developer
   workflow requires discrete tasks that can be prioritized and
   resolved independently.

If you're not sure what to put into a field, don't sweat it.  The
important fields are *Summary*, *Environment*, and *Description*.

Bug reports are highly useful contributions.  We appreciate the time
you give to make Qpid better.
