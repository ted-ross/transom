# AMQP

The Advanced Message Queueing Protocol is at the heart of everything
we do at Qpid. It is an open standard designed to support reliable,
high-performance messaging over the internet. AMQP can be used for any
distributed application and supports common messaging patterns such as
point-to-point, fan-out, publish-subscribe, and request-response.

## AMQP and your app

We offer a library, [Qpid Proton](proton/index.html), whose explicit
aim is to help you make your application speak AMQP.
