# AMQP Messenger

AMQP Messenger offers a simple but powerful programming model.
Connection management happens under the covers, leaving you to focus
on your application.  Messenger supports point-to-point messaging.

The AMQP Messenger API is part of the
[Qpid Proton](@site-url@/proton/index.html) toolkit for making any
application speak AMQP.
